# Chrome OS Navigation Demo

## This is not an official Google product

Android apps should look good on all sorts of screen sizes. This
demo shows one way to handle navigation across portrait, landscape
wide portait, and wide landscape layouts by switching between a
bottom navigation, side navigation, and expanded side navigation
pattern, depending on available screen width.
